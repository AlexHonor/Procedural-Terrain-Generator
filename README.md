# Procedural-Terrain-Generator
A simplistic C++ OpenGL procedural terrain generator.

It was made by me in 2017 for the Computer Graphics course.

Uses diamond-square algorithm to generate the terrain.

#Building it!
This sample is dependent on:
-GLAD
-GLFW
-GLM
-FreeImage

Project is using CMake as build tool, so it is possible to build it almost on any platform GLFW might run on, but the dependencies binaries are provided only for the Windows platform. So if you want to build it on any other platform you would have to build the dependencies yourself.
